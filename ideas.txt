Necessities
--------------------------------

* Shell script breaks virtual environments - safe mode?

* Mapping function fix when only directories are present

* Notification text when directory is inaccessible (in progress)





Optimization
--------------------------------

* Bottlenecks with checking validity of directories







Improvement
--------------------------------

* Alt-Key function (in progress)

* Alphabetic mode? Typing adds to a string which changes selected
  directory? Would break h, j, k, l feature

* Coloring directories if they're inaccessible
